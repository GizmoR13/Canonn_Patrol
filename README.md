# Canonn Patrol


Primarily, it is a route planner with a solution to the "traveling salesman" problem.
It contains basic information about the systems.

 - Pending, Active, Recovery are faction states, not system states.
 - Stations refer to the number of stations under the factionâ€™s control, not all stations in the system.

By default, Canonn systems are loaded, but other factions can also be checked. They are added to the list of checked factions and can be browsed without reloading until the page is closed.
Systems from the planned route can be copied individually or downloaded as a CSV file.

Data from Elite BGS, Power data from EDSM (test)
